### The Unification Process and The Naming Issue

Microsoft has recognized the confusion caused by multiple frameworks and versions and has taken steps to streamline and simplify the ecosystem. The move towards a unified .NET platform aims to provide a more cohesive and consistent experience for developers across different application types and platforms.

During the Microsoft Build 2019 conference in May, the introduction of .NET 5 marked a significant milestone for developers across various platforms, including desktop, web, mobile, cloud, and devices. This platform update represented a rare convergence, unifying disparate frameworks, streamlining code complexity, and advancing cross-platform capabilities.

Microsoft's ambitious goal was to merge the source code streams of key frameworks, namely .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin/Mono. This endeavour aimed to bridge historical gaps that had emerged and provide developers with a single target framework for their projects.

According to the [`.NET Reunify Plan`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2019/july/csharp-net-reunified-microsoft%E2%80%99s-plans-for-net-5) that Microsoft has planned and created the roadmap for, you can see that the unification process will be completed in the yellow area in the image below:

<div align="center">

    <figcaption>Image Source: <a href="https://intellitect.com/blog/net-5-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IntelliTect</a></figcaption>
</div>

The transition from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 5 is a pivotal moment. Microsoft's decision to skip version 4.x and adopt .NET 5 is due to the following reasons:

- #### Avoiding Version Confusion:

The leap from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 5 is more than a numerical jump; it's a deliberate move to sidestep confusion with the existing .NET Framework 4.x. Microsoft's decision to skip version numbers 4.x communicates that this release is not just an incremental update but a substantial advancement. This strategic versioning ensures that developers recognize the magnitude of the changes and innovations introduced in .NET 5.

- #### Dropping the "Core" for Emphasis:

The removal of "Core" from the framework's name is more than a cosmetic change. It signifies a shift in focus, emphasizing that .NET 5 is the principal implementation of the framework going forward. This move is a declaration of maturity and completeness, indicating that .NET is no longer confined to a subset. It is a comprehensive and inclusive framework that supports a diverse range of applications and platforms.

</div>

- #### ASP.NET Core 5.0 and Entity Framework Core 5.0:

While the overarching framework adopted the streamlined moniker, certain components retained the "Core" in their names for practical reasons. ASP.NET Core 5.0 and Entity Framework Core 5.0 maintained their identifiers to ensure a smooth transition for developers familiar with the previous versionsâ€”ASP.NET MVC 5 and Entity Framework 5/6, respectively. This decision reflects Microsoft's commitment to clarity and compatibility in the evolving landscape.

## Bridging the Divide with .NET Standard

While .NET Core was a step in the right direction, a new challenge emerged â€“ the fragmentation of APIs across various .NET implementations. This prompted the creation of .NET Standard, a specification that defined a set of APIs to be implemented by all .NET platforms.

.NET Standard acted as a bridge between .NET Framework and .NET Core, ensuring compatibility and facilitating the transition to the new paradigm. Developers could now create libraries targeting .NET Standard, guaranteeing compatibility with any platform implementing the standard, be it .NET Framework, .NET Core, or future versions.

### JIT and AOT

In the context of .NET, AOT (Ahead-of-Time Compilation) and JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation) refer to different compilation strategies used to convert high-level code into machine code that can be executed by the computer's hardware. These strategies have varying impacts on the performance of applications developed using .NET Core and .NET Framework.

- #### JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation:

  When a .NET application is compiled, the source code is translated into an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL) or simply Intermediate Language (IL).
  IL is a low-level, platform-agnostic representation of the code that can be executed by the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
  Rather than compiling the entire application to native machine code during the build process, .NET applications are distributed with their IL code.
  When the application is run, the CLR (Common Language Runtime) dynamically compiles the IL code into native machine code that is specific to the host system's architecture.
  This dynamic compilation occurs "just-in-time" before the code is executed.

| **JIT**                  | **.NET Core**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **.NET Framework**                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compilation**          | NET Core predominantly uses JIT compilation. The Just-In-Time compiler translates Intermediate Language (IL) code into native machine code at runtime, just before the application executes. This allows for platform-specific optimizations and adaptability to the underlying hardware. | Like .NET Core, the traditional .NET Framework also relies on JIT compilation. The process occurs dynamically during program execution.                                                                              |
| **Performance Benefits** | JIT compilation can result in optimized code tailored to the specific environment where the application is running. This can lead to improved performance as the compiler can take advantage of the target machine's architecture and capabilities.                                       | JIT compilation in .NET Framework allows for adaptability, but it may introduce some startup latency as the compilation occurs at runtime. In scenarios where startup time is critical, this can be a consideration. |

- #### AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) Compilation:

  AOT refers to the compilation strategy where the code is translated from a high-level language (such as C# in the case of .NET) directly into native machine code during the build process, ahead of the application's execution.

| **AOT**                  | **.NET Core**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **.NET Framework**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compilation**          | While .NET Core primarily uses JIT compilation, there are scenarios where Ahead-of-Time compilation is employed. For example, .NET Core applications can be compiled ahead of time into native machine code using tools like .NET Native. This AOT compilation can be beneficial for reducing startup times and improving performance in certain scenarios. | .NET Framework has limited support for AOT compilation. The use of NGEN (Native Image Generator) allows developers to create native images ahead of time for some assemblies. However, it doesn't cover the entire application, and the benefits are not as extensive as in .NET Core. |
| **Performance Benefits** | AOT compilation can eliminate the need for JIT compilation at runtime, leading to faster startup times. This can be crucial in scenarios where rapid application launch is essential, such as in mobile or serverless environments.                                                                                                                         | While NGEN can help in reducing startup time for specific assemblies, the overall impact on performance may be less pronounced compared to .NET Core's AOT capabilities.                                                                                                               |

Alright, let's break it down. When you're working with .NET, deciding between JIT and AOT compilation is a big deal. So, here's the deal: JIT compiles your code on the go, as it runs, in both .NET Core and .NET Framework. It's adaptable to your hardware, which is cool. On the flip side, AOT compilation precompiles your code into machine language, scoring points for faster startup times. Now, here's where things get interesting. There are some considerations you should keep in mind when making this decision. We're talking about how fast your app starts up, whether it plays nice with your hardware, how much memory it chews up, and more. Let's get into those considerations:

| **Considerations**                | **JIT Compilation**                                                                                                                                             | **AOT Compilation**                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Startup Time**                  | - Introduces startup latency as code is compiled at runtime.- Fast startup times crucial for scenarios like serverless computing or containerized environments. | - Significantly reduces startup time by precompiling code into native machine code.                                                                                   |
| **Adaptability and Optimization** | - Offers adaptability to the underlying hardware.- Potential for runtime optimizations.                                                                         | - Provides extensive optimization during compilation phase.- May lack adaptability to runtime changes.                                                                |
| **Memory Usage**                  | - Can lead to higher memory usage as both IL code and native code coexist in memory.                                                                            | - May result in more efficient memory usage as the native code is generated ahead of time.                                                                            |
| **Runtime Performance**           | - Allows for platform-specific optimizations, potentially leading to better runtime performance.                                                                | - Offers optimized performance due to extensive precompilation.                                                                                                       |
| **Binary Size**                   | - Generates machine code tailored to the specific platform at runtime, resulting in potentially smaller binaries.- Binary size depends on the platform.         | - May result in larger binaries due to precompiled machine code.- Binary size is generally larger and may depend on the specific AOT tool used and its configuration. |
| **Development Workflow**          | - Simplifies development workflow by allowing late binding and dynamic loading of assemblies.                                                                   | - Requires additional considerations during development due to the need for precompilation.                                                                           |

</div><br/>

.NET, Microsoft's toolkit, has a life cycle, starting from when it's born to when it retires. There are two types of versions: Long-Term Support (LTS) for stability (3 years of support) and Standard Term Support (STS) for the latest features (18 months of support).

Imagine a family album with versions like .NET 8 and .NET 7, showing when they were born and when they retire. Some, like .NET 5, have retired.

There are also preview releases (not for regular use) and Go-Live releases (for production). Every November, there's a big release â€“ even-numbered ones for stability, odd-numbered for excitement.

Joining the LTS or STS club means keeping your software up-to-date. Patch updates are like vitamins, bundled up every month on "Patch Tuesday."

Updates are active for a while, improving functionality. The last 6 months focus on security â€“ the retirement plan for software.

End of Life (EOL) is when Microsoft stops helping. It's like saying bye to an old friend for a newer version.

.NET's support policy includes ASP.NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework, following ASP.NET Support rules. It works on various operating systems, and Windows users get automatic patching.

Understanding the support policy helps your .NET projects stay healthy.

## Conclusion

The evolution of .NET â€”from Framework to Coreâ€” reflects a commitment to adaptability and innovation. .NET Framework laid the foundation for Windows development, .NET Core expanded the horizons with cross-platform capabilities, and .NET Standard served as the glue to unite the ecosystem. As we move forward, Microsoft has further streamlined the .NET landscape with the introduction of .NET 5 and beyond, unifying the best of .NET Framework and .NET Core into a single, versatile platform. The journey of .NET continues, promising a future of powerful, cross-platform development for the global developer community.
