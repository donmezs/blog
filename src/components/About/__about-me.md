I am a software engineer based in Izmir. I have ***5+*** years of experience and counting. I have an extensive background in the full software development lifecycle including design, coding, testing, debugging and maintenance of web and desktop applications using Microsoft technologies (including ***.NET Framework*** and ***modern .NET***), ***MERN*** stack, and ***MEAN*** stack.

In addition to my work as a ***.NET*** Developer, I am deeply interested in the ***Web3*** area and its potential to transform the way we interact with digital assets and decentralized networks.

I absolutely adore being a software developer; it allows me to mix my love of ***coffee*** with my powers of modern-day ***sorcery***, all while wearing my trusty pajamas as I build innovative solutions that can make a meaningful impact in the world.

I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with like-minded professionals. If you are interested in discussing potential opportunities, feel free to connect with me or send me a message.
