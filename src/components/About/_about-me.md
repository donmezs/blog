I am a software engineer based in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qwUBSGdFjjhU2sMD9" target="blank">`Izmir`</a>. I have approximately **_7_** years of experience and counting. I have an extensive background in the full software development lifecycle including design, coding, testing, debugging and maintenance of web and desktop applications using Microsoft technologies (including **_.NET Framework_** and **_modern .NET_**), **_MERN_** stack, and **_MEAN_** stack.

In addition to my work as a **_.NET_** Software Engineer, I am deeply interested in the **_Web3_** area and its potential to transform the way we interact with digital assets and decentralized networks.

I absolutely adore being a software engineer; it allows me to mix my love of **_coffee_** with my powers of modern-day **_sorcery_**, all while wearing my trusty pajamas as I build innovative solutions that can make a meaningful impact in the world.

I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with like-minded professionals. If you are interested in discussing potential opportunities, feel free to connect with me or send me a message.
